# WFM_Conf

For storing temporary files such as logs and discarded configurations that might be needed again in the future.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a **backup storage** for:

- Logs from various SmartWFM processes.
- Old or discarded configuration files.
- Temporary or obsolete data that might be referenced later.

These files are kept here as a reference or backup in case they are required for troubleshooting or future use.
